#   Mission-To-Mars-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Robin is a Junior Data Scientist who does freelance astronomy work in spare time. Robin dreams to land a job in NASA and keeps on visiting astronomy web sites to collect information. She is specially interested in Mars and frequently visits websites related to Mission to Mars.
While visiting one of the sites, she has a question as to how much water did the Red Planet have in its youth.
She wants to gather all the required information in one location from various web sites, and then show it off to other astrophiles.
The objective of this project is to:
Write a python script to scrape through data from different websites.
Store the collected data into a NoSQL Database - Mongo DB
Put the collected information into a Web Application using Flask

## Purpose

The required information is available in multiple websites.

The purpose of this project is to provide the below deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components and display the results

We have to scrape Mars data such as the latest images, headlines, table data and hemisphere images, then store this information into MongoDB and display the required information in a web-application using Flask, HTML and Bootstrap.

## Results

Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

The Hemisphere Images and Titles have been scraped using the below code:
